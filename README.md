# TCGoat: Hack-Upstate-XII


Our program is a Python application to find the coolest swag that TCGPlayer has to offer. To do this, it uses a simple Discord bot.

discord.ext.commands is overrated, take my word for it.

After the end of Hack Upstate XII, we plan to use and improve upon this source code and see where else we can take it. Our goal is simply to have some fun with this project.

* **NOTES:**
